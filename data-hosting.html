				<h2 class="subPageTitle">Data Hosting</h2>
				<div class="subPageText">
					<p>One of the most consistent and frustrating costs of running a business is the need to maintain reliable computers in your office. This is especially true with your server. It has to work at peak efficiency to maintain the proper communication for your networked data.</p>

					<p>Servers require larger upfront costs to purchase, installation fees, and ongoing maintenance. If the server stops working on a network system, so does your Medisoft.</p>
					
					<p>Paragon Medical Technology is proud to offer a powerful and simple solution to this concern: data hosting.</p>
					
					<p>The process is very simple and we take care of all the work for you. The data is stored on our servers, freeing you from the expense and maintenance. Then you simply connect to it from your office using our secured internet connection. That's it.</p>
					
					<p>You gain the ability to access your Medisoft data, schedule, and any hosted products from anywhere you have a reliable internet connection. That alone is all many offices need to make it worth their while.
					You still own your Medisoft. You still own your data. What we do is take the burden of the server hardware off your shoulders.</p>
					
					<p>We take care of the access licenses needed for your office, which may save you hundreds or thousands of dollars. You only pay a single monthly bill to cover the connection fee to the data.</p>
					
					<p>This fee is priced per user, meaning you only need to purchase as many connections as you would have simultaneous users. An office of five, for example, could have as few as one connection if only one person was using Medisoft or a connected product at any given time.</p>
