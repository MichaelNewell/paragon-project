				<h2 class="subPageTitle">Data Hosting</h2>
				<div class="subPageText">
					<p>One of the most consistent and frustrating costs of running a business is the need to maintain reliable computers in your office. This is especially true with the server because it has to work at peak efficiency to maintain the proper communication of your networked Medisoft data to the various workstations in your office.

					Servers require larger upfront costs to purchase, installation fees, and ongoing maintenance. If the server stops working on a network system, so does your Medisoft.
					
					Paragon Medical Technology is proud to offer a powerful and simple solution to this concern: data hosting.
					
					The process is very simple and we take care of all the work for you. The data is stored on our servers, freeing you from the expense and maintenance. Then you simply connect to it from your office using our secured internet connection. That's it.
					
					You gain the ability to access your Medisoft data, schedule, and any hosted products from anywhere you have a reliable internet connection. That alone is all many offices need to make it worth their while.
					You still own your Medisoft. You still own your data. What we do is take the burden of the server hardware off your shoulders.
					
					We take care of the Medisoft licenses needed for your office, which may save you hundreds or thousands of dollars. You only pay a single monthly bill to cover the connection fee to the data.
					
					This fee is priced per user, meaning you only need to purchase as many connections as you would have simultaneous users. An office of five, for example, could have as few as one connection if only one person was using Medisoft or a connected product at any given time.
					
					Among the many benefits of data hosting are:
					
					We will take care of your backups for you; performed nightly, stored offsite, exceeding HIPAA requirements.
					
					We will keep up with the latest releases of service packs and automatically load them keeping your applications running in optimal condition.
					
					We will make sure virus protection is up-to-date.
					
					Outsourcing the management of a network infrastructure may reduce total cost of ownership.
					
					Eliminate the Expensive PC Upgrade Cycles
					
					Access to applications for remote offices and mobile workforce without a wide area network.
					
					Free up the time of in house staff by reducing some application administrative tasks and eliminating others.
					
					Some budgets handle a monthly fee better as opposed to a larger up-front purchase cost to build infrastructure.
					
					Connect two offices together without large WAN costs.
					
					Print from any location.
					
					We pride ourselves on dealing relationally with our customers. We will take ownership of any support issue you would experience, care and resolve it to completion.
					
					Security, 128 bit Encryption & Firewalls.
					
					No Advantage licenses for Medisoft need to be purchased.
					
					We can host other applications besides Medisoft such as Microsoft Office, etcâ€¦
					
					We can support any size organization.
					
					More and more offices are taking advantage of the ability to access their Medisoft and schedules from anywhere in the world with an internet connection. They decrease their own costs and maintenance worries while improving efficiency and data reliability.
					
					Interested? Let us show you how we can take your busy office to the next level.
				
					System Requirements- 
					Windows XP SP3, Windows Vista SP1, or Windows 7 and Internet Explorer
					Macintosh Power PC, Mac OS X v10.2.8 or later
					Some form of broadband Internet connectivity is recommended in order to get optimum performance and value from your Network Desktops. This could be ISDN, DSL, ADSL, IDSL or cable.
